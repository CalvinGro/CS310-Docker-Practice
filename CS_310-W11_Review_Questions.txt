What process did you follow for creating the dockerfile?
- I set the working directory, copied the requirements and installed
  them, then I made a copy of the directory, and then I exposed the 
  port for it to run on and ran it.
  
What docker commands did you use to run the image?

sudo docker build -t calvinsite:1.0 .
# I used -t to give it the name and create a version number.

sudo docker run -d --name myflasksite -p 8000:8000 calvinsite:1.0
